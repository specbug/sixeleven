In Python, the code `a = [1] * 5` evals to $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$; essentially five *copies* of the same object. Consider the following code:

```python
# init a 2D list of zeros
matrix = [[0] * 5] * 5
```

It simply creates a $5 X 5$ matrix with all values defaulted to zero.
![Matrix](/images/pymut1.svg?width=300&height=300)

Now, if we simply change the element at $(0, 0)$ to $2$,

```python
# change the element at (0, 0) to 2
matrix[0][0] = 2
```

and plot the array:
![Matrix](/images/pymut2.svg?width=300&height=300)

The output is not what you expect. Instead of changing the element at $(0, 0)$ to $2$, the entire first row is updated to $2$!

### The Curious Case of Mutables

Alright let’s unravel this. The line `[0] * 5` creates five references to the object $0$. An object is just some data residing in some memory location. And a reference is a pointer to that object. In the above case, all five copies point to the same memory location (which contains an object $"0"$).

And `[[0] * 5] * 5` just creates five references to that object (the internal list $[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$).

As a consequence, mutating any one list affects all the lists.

```python
matrix[0] is matrix[1] # compares if two objects are infact the same object
# True
matrix[0][0] is matrix[1][0]
# True
```

Now, consider the following case

```python
# init a vector of zeros
vector = [0] * 5
```

![Vector](/images/pymut5.svg?width=300&height=300)

Again, Python just creates five references to the same $”0”$, as seen above (& below).
![Obj Ref](/images/pymut6.png)

```python
vector[0] is vector[1]
# True
```

So, if we change the first element to $2$, it should essentially change the list to $[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]$, right?

```python
# change the first element to 2
vector[0] = 2
```

Which actually results in
![Vector](/images/pymut7.svg?width=300&height=300)

Huh. How come mutating the object didn’t affect the other copies, in this case?

Because integers are **immutable** objects, i.e., you cannot mutate them (okay poor use of ‘i.e.’). Whereas Python lists are **mutable** objects. **If you mutate an immutable object, it snaps all existing references (pointers) to that object & creates a new object instead (with a new reference).**

Hence, when we mutated a `list` it overrode the original object & all pointers continued pointing to the same location, ignorant. But mutating an `int` de-referenced existing pointers & created a new object with a new reference to it.

```python
vector[0] is vector[1]
# False
```

### Visualising Stackframes

**Case 1: mutating a mutable object**

```python
l = [[0] * 5] * 5
l[0][0] = 2
fcol = [x[0] for x in l]
print(fcol)
```

**Case 2: mutating an immutable object**

```python
l = [0] * 5
l[0] = 2
f = l[0]
print(l)
```
