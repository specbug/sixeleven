# Testing Inline Code Formatting

This post tests how inline code looks in both light and dark modes.

## Basic Inline Code

Here's some inline code: `const greeting = "Hello, world!";`

## Code with Special Characters

Here's code with special characters: `function add(a, b) { return a + b; }`

## PGP Key Example

PGP key (fingerprint: `4A44 7FB6 EBBE 0E29 A059 0BFC 52BC 4AF4 6F76 87D9`)

## Multiple Inline Code Blocks

You can use `useState()` and `useEffect()` hooks in React to manage component state and side effects.

## Code with Numbers and Symbols

Configuration: `PORT=3000 NODE_ENV=production npm start`
