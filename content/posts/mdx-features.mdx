# Advanced MDX Techniques for Interactive Technical Documentation

## The Evolution of Documentation

Technical documentation has evolved significantly over the years:

1. **Static text documents** (1970s-1990s)
2. **HTML-based documentation** (1990s-2010s)
3. **Interactive documentation** (2010s-present)

MDX represents the cutting edge of this evolution, combining the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components.

## Why MDX Excels for Technical Documentation

MDX offers several advantages over traditional documentation formats:

- **Familiar syntax**: Authors can use Markdown's intuitive formatting
- **Component integration**: Complex UI elements can be embedded directly
- **Interactive examples**: Code can be demonstrated and executed in-place
- **Consistent styling**: Design systems can be applied across documentation

## Essential MDX Patterns

### Interactive Code Examples

```jsx
// This is a simple example of an interactive code block
function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
