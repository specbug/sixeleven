# About Me

I'm a writer, developer, and thinker interested in technology, design, and the intersection of human cognition and digital interfaces. This blog is where I share my thoughts, ideas, and projects.

My background includes software development, UX design, and cognitive psychology research. I'm particularly interested in how we can create digital experiences that work with our cognitive processes rather than against them.

## About This Site

This site is built with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and MDX. It's designed to be minimalist and content-focused, drawing inspiration from sites like LessWrong, Gwern.net, and Quanta Magazine.

The design principles for this site include:

- Content-first approach with minimal distractions
- Clean typography for comfortable reading
- Responsive design that works well on all devices
- Dark mode support for comfortable reading in different lighting conditions

## My Work

I focus on creating thoughtful, well-crafted digital experiences that respect users' attention and cognitive capacity. Some of my interests include:

- **Minimalist Design**: Creating interfaces that communicate clearly with minimal cognitive load
- **Digital Writing**: Exploring new formats for sharing complex ideas online
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Researching how we can make technology more humane and intuitive
- **Open Source**: Contributing to projects that make technology more accessible and ethical
