My name is Rishit Vora. I’m a software engineer at a cloud-security company in Bengaluru, India. I've previously worked as a founding engineer at a YC startup, and then some more at various companies. I'm not an amazing software engineer, nor an exceptional student—but I'm a better student than most engineers and a better engineer than most students.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading sci-fi and rational fiction, and I'm currently learning to play the keyboard. My idea of relaxation is playing Souls-like games (Elden Ring ftw) or enjoying a movie. I also have a particular fondness for _starting_ things—learning subjects from scratch (enjoying this economics course), diving into new projects (building a self-driving model robot), picking up an instrument, or starting a blog. Although, persistence isn't second nature to me yet – but I’m working on it!

**What is this sixeleven thing?** The name is a playful combination of Gödel's incompleteness theorems—VI & XI. It captures my fascination with the inherent limitations of systems (& knowledge); and somewhat reflects the epistemic status of my ideas.
