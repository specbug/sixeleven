My name is Rishit Vora. I’m a software engineer at a cloud-security company in Bengaluru, India. I've previously worked as a founding engineer at a YC startup, and then some more at various others.

**Who _are_ you, anyway?** In the current slice of spacetime, I enjoy reading sci-fi and rational fiction, and I'm currently learning to play the keyboard. My idea of relaxation is playing Souls-like games (Elden Ring ftw) or immersing in a movie. I also have a particular fondness for _starting_ things—learning subjects from scratch (enjoying [this](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP62oJSoqb4Rf-vZMGUBe59G-&si=8aHuUiwizGvri7j0) macro-economics course), diving into new projects ([writing](https://github.com/specbug/punygrad) a puny auto-grad engine in pure python), picking up an instrument, or starting a blog. Although, persistence isn't second nature to me yet – but I’m working on it! I'm not an amazing software engineer, nor an exceptional student—but I'm a better student than most engineers and a better engineer than most students.

**What is this sixeleven thing?** The name is a playful combination of Gödel's incompleteness theorems—VI & XI. It captures my fascination with the inherent limitations of systems (& knowledge); and somewhat reflects the epistemic status of my ideas.
